<h1>Images Description</h1>
<p>All background images were designed by me using using Procreate, including my logo, or else screenshots of the code visuals.</p>

<h1>Layout</h1>
<p>My goal was to make an easy to navigate, clean interface, using each page to display a specific requirement of the project.</p>

<h1>Templates</h1>
<p>I used some bootstrap templates for the navbars, along with W3Schools for the About Me section. I found it easier to grab the bootstrap templates in pieces from W3 as needed instead of downloading from bootstrap.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>I learned about a lot of great tools during this project, with help from free blogs and resources, along with fellow students. Here are some notable ones I used in this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unminify - sorts out huge blocks of minified code.</li>
<li>PurifyCSS - generally can declutter and take out any unused CSS, very helpful with Bootstrap but definitely not guaranteed to get everything.</li>
<li>Coolors - I love to use this for digital design, takes away tons of time if you are like me and get very picky about color pallettes.</li>
<li> w3schools - pretty much with anything you could need.</li>
<li>Loom - I used Loom for my intro video because Youtube kinda scares me, very user friendly for a simple video.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>My goal after this project is to get more organized on Github, which will make it much easier to sort and track my files for adding to my portfolio. As I add more projects I will probably add categories into the portfolio section and make the landing page more about me, or one big project I am working on. I also plan on adding more layout design as I get more comfortable with templates.</p>
